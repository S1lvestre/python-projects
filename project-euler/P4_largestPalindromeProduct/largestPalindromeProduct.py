# Largest palindrome product
# Problem 4

# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
# from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# largest number we can obtain by mltiplying 2 3-digit numbers:
# 999 * 999 = 998001

maxPal = 998001
